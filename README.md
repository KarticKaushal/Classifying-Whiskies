Scotch Whisky
 
Scotch whisky is prized for its complexity and variety of flavors. And the regions of Scotland where it is produced are believed
to have distinct flavor profiles. 

In this case study, we will classify scotch whiskies based on their flavor characteristics. The dataset we'll be using contains a
selection of scotch whiskies from several distilleries, and we'll attempt to cluster whiskies into groups that are similar in flavor.

This case study will deepen your understanding of Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, and perhaps of Scotch Whisky.

The dataset we'll be using consists of tasting ratings of one readily available single malt scotch whisky from almost every active
whisky distillery in Scotland. The resulting dataset has 86 malt whiskies that are scored between 0 and 4 in 12 different taste categories.
The scores have been aggregated from 10 different tasters. The taste categories describe whether the whiskies are sweet, smoky, medicinal,
spicy, and so on.

I did this project to accompany my learnings from HarvardX course - PH526x Using Python for Research.
